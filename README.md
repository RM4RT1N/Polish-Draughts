# Polish-Draughts
#
The project was created as an exercise during the course. 

The application is a digital version of the game Polish Draughts. 

The aim of the project was to write a console version of the game using Java and object-oriented programming.  

The project is written in a very simple way, and includes an interesting graphical representation of the game state created using only characters displayed in the console. 

In the future, a computer opponent can be added to the application, and an editable graphical layout can be developed in the terminal , or a new front can be added to the existing code. ##

The current version is a backend application.
